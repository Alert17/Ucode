<h1>PROTOCOLS</h1>

    <div class="box">

        <p>HTTPS status code<br><br>100 Continue
            The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body (in the
            case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). Sending a large request
            body to a server after a request has been rejected for inappropriate headers would be inefficient. To have
            a server check the request's headers, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial
            request and receive a 100 Continue status code in response before sending the body. If the client receives
            an error code such as 403 (Forbidden) or 405 (Method Not Allowed) then it should not send the request's
            body. The response 417 Expectation Failed indicates that the request should be repeated without the Expect
            header as it indicates that the server does not support expectations (this is the case, for example,
            of HTTP/1.0 servers).<br><br>
            101 Switching Protocols<br><br>
            The requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server has agreed to do so.<br><br>
            102 Processing (WebDAV; RFC 2518)<br><br>
            A WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, requiring a long time to complete
            the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no
            response is available yet. This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.
            103 Early Hints (RFC 8297)<br><br>
            Used to return some response headers before final HTTP message.</p>

        <p>HTTPS methods<br><br>9.1.1 Safe Methods
            Implementors should be aware that the software represents the user in their interactions over the Internet,
            and should be careful to allow the user to be aware of any actions they might take which may have an
            unexpected significance to themselves or others.<br><br>

            In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the
            significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe".
            This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way,
            so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.<br><br>

            Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result
            of performing a GET request; in fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important
            distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects, so therefore cannot be held
            accountable for them.<br><br>

            9.1.2 Idempotent Methods<br><br>
            Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from error or expiration issues)
            the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD,
            PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have side effects, and
            so are inherently idempotent.<br><br>

            However, it is possible that a sequence of several requests is non- idempotent, even if all of the
            methods executed in that sequence are idempotent. (A sequence is idempotent if a single execution of
            the entire sequence always yields a result that is not changed by a reexecution of all, or part, of that
            sequence.) For example, a sequence is non-idempotent if its result depends on a value that is later
            modified in the same sequence.<br><br>

            A sequence that never has side effects is idempotent, by definition (provided that no concurrent
            operations are being executed on the same set of resources).

        <p>DNS types<br><br>Recursive Query<br><br>
            In a recursive query, a DNS client provides a hostname, and the DNS Resolver “must” provide an answer—it
            responds with either a relevant resource record, or an error message if it can't be found. The resolver
            starts a recursive query process, starting from the DNS Root Server, until it finds the Authoritative Name
            Server (for more on Authoritative Name Servers see DNS Server Types below) that holds the IP address and
            other information for the requested hostname.<br><br>

            Iterative Query<br><br>
            In an iterative query, a DNS client provides a hostname, and the DNS Resolver returns the best answer
            it can. If the DNS resolver has the relevant DNS records in its cache, it returns them. If not,
            it refers the DNS client to the Root Server, or another Authoritative Name Server which is nearest
            to the required DNS zone. The DNS client must then repeat the query directly against the DNS server it
            was referred to.<br><br>

            Non-Recursive Query<br><br>
            A non-recursive query is a query in which the DNS Resolver already knows the answer. It either immediately
            returns a DNS record because it already stores it in local cache, or queries a DNS Name Server which is
            authoritative for the record, meaning it definitely holds the correct IP for that hostname. In both cases,
            there is no need for additional rounds of queries (like in recursive or iterative queries). Rather, a
            response is immediately returned to the client.
