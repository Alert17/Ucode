            <h2 id="heromakes">What makes a superhero?</h2>
            <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal
                person couldn’t.  So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than
                any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.
                Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>
                For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or
                human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a
                superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t
                accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

            <p> Steve Rogers was born during the Depression and grew up a frail youth in a poor family.
                His father died when he was a child, his mother when he was in his late teens.
                Horrified by newsreel footage of the Nazis in Europe, Rogers was inspired to try to enlist in the Army.
                However, because of his frailty and sickness, he was rejected. Overhearing the boy's
                earnest plea to be accepted, General Chester Phillips of the U.S. Army offered Rogers the opportunity to take
                part in a special experiment called Operation: Rebirth. Rogers agreed and was taken to a secret laboratory
                in Washington, D.C. where he was introduced to Dr. Abrahan Erskine (code named: Prof. Reinstein), the creator
                to the Super-Soldier formula.</p>
